**Working within the scope**

https://github.com/CoreyM21/Ruby-On-Rails-Donut-Review-App

For my Ruby on Rails project, I wanted to stick to the idea that this could potentially be used now and not just exist in the vacuum of, "Well, I built this for school and I want to show it off later in portfolio" but more in the idea that, I can take this project that I di for school and allow people to use it now. One of the many companies I have been apsrt of include North Fork Donut Company located on Long Island, NY. Something their company needs but does not have is a way to gauge people's reactions to the donuts they were creating, past and present! This could: 1. Build a rapport with their customer 2. Engage with their audience in a more personal manner and finally 3. Discover fan favorites and why! Its all about buidling a better business and for myself, learning and implimenting the lessons learned to practical world applications.
